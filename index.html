            <p>As a young man, his father bought him <em>The Complete Beatles Songbook</em>, and Daniel began incorporating their chord progressions into his music. After graduating high school in 1979, Daniel majored in Art at Kent State University in Ohio. There he met Laurie Allen, who became the love of his life and creative muse. She encouraged Daniel to record his songs, which became the material for his first albums.</p>

            <p><span class="dropcap">I</span>n 1981 Daniel began recording his songs onto a lo-fi $59 Sanyo cassette recorder, and made his first album <em>Songs of Pain</em>, illustrated with his artwork. Bouts of mental illness forced Daniel to abandon art school, and he moved to Texas to live with his brother. During the recording of <em>Hi, How Are You?</em> he suffered a nervous breakdown that led his family to consider having him institutionalized. He decided to join a traveling carnival instead, briefly touring the country selling hot dogs, until landing back in Austin, Texas. There Daniel began handing out his home-made cassettes of his simple, yet rivetingly honest recordings, which attracted the attention of Austin's music scene. In 1986, while working at McDonald's, Daniel won the <em>Austin Chronicle</em>'s "Songwriter and Best Folk Artist of the Year" award, and was featured on MTV's <em>Cutting Edge</em>.</p>

            <p>In 1992, Kurt Cobain increased Daniel's notoriety by accepting an MTV award wearing a shirt with Daniel's art.
